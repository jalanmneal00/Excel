What is displayed in the pictures is a data analysis and visualization of different products from different companies. 
I am demonstrating that I can work with enormous data sets in excel.
I utilized many different pivot tables and pivot table techniques, while also utilizing relevant functions/equations to get desired results and answers.
I compare the data in total/sum of sales, shipping time, and regions, etc.
I utilize graphs in excel to give a visualization of how the data compares to one another.
Couldn't upload the excel file because it was way too large, so I settled for these screenshots.
